# Sankalp Mathur

Welcome to my portfolio, where I showcase my projects and skills as a Flutter developer and mechanical engineering student.

## About Me

I'm a passionate Flutter developer with a strong interest in both software development and mechanical engineering. Currently pursuing a B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering, I'm excited to merge my engineering knowledge with my programming skills to create innovative solutions.

## Projects

### Project 1: Flutter Notes App

- **Description:** The Firestore Note App with BLoC is a powerful and intuitive note-taking application built using the Flutter framework. This app enables users to create, edit, and manage their notes seamlessly while harnessing the capabilities of Firebase Firestore for real-time data synchronization.
- **Features**
User Authentication: Users can create accounts or log in using their credentials, ensuring a secure and personalized experience.

Note Creation and Editing: Users can effortlessly create new notes, edit existing ones, and apply formatting to their text content.

Real-time Synchronization: The app utilizes Firebase Firestore to synchronize notes across multiple devices in real time, providing users with instant access to their content.

BLoC State Management: The BLoC (Business Logic Component) architecture is employed for effective state management. This ensures a separation of concerns, making the app more maintainable and testable.

Categorization and Organization: Notes can be organized into categories or folders, allowing users to keep their thoughts and ideas well-structured.

Search and Filtering: A robust search functionality enables users to quickly locate specific notes by keywords. Filtering options further enhance the user experience.

Responsive Design: The app's user interface is responsive, adapting to various screen sizes and orientations, providing a consistent experience across devices.
- **Technologies Used**
Flutter: The app is developed using the Flutter framework, enabling cross-platform compatibility and a native-like user experience.

Firebase Firestore: Firestore is used to store and synchronize note data across devices in real time.

BLoC State Management: The BLoC pattern is employed to manage the app's state and logic, promoting efficient code organization.

Firebase Authentication: User authentication and security are ensured through Firebase Authentication services.

Firebase Storage: Firebase Storage is used for efficiently managing and storing user-uploaded images or media within notes.
